# Network-Visualization-Parallel-Coordinates

This was a final group project for Data Visualization class. I was the lead developer.

The GUI had two screens:
  First screen: parallel coordinates are used to display how many nodes there are per network(each vertical line represents a network)
  Second screen: either shows a single network or two networks side by side. Parallel coordinates are used to show the usage of a node                     (router or computer)
Mouse interactions were used to go back and forth between the screens
